🩸 Blood Donation Platform

A full-stack web application designed to connect people in urgent need of blood with registered donors efficiently. The platform enables users to register, log in, create blood requests, view active requests, and accept requests—helping streamline communication during medical emergencies.

This project is built as a real-world MERN stack application, with a strong focus on functionality, scalability, and clean architecture.
