🩸 Blood Donation Platform

A full-stack web application designed to connect people in urgent need of blood with registered donors efficiently. The platform allows users to register, log in, create blood requests, view active requests, and accept requests, helping to streamline communication during emergencies.

This project is built as a real-world MERN stack application focusing on functionality, scalability, and clean architecture.
