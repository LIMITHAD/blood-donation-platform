# Blood Donation Platform

The Blood Donation Platform is a full-stack web application developed to connect individuals in urgent need of blood with registered donors in an efficient and organized manner.  
The platform enables users to register, log in, create blood requests, view active requests, and accept requests, helping improve communication during medical emergencies.

This project is built as a real-world MERN stack application with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and practical problem-solving.
